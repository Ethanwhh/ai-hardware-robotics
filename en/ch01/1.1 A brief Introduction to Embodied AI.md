## 1. What is Embodied AI? — Beyond Thinking, It's About "Action"

You may already be familiar with "artificial intelligence," such as ChatGPT, which chats with you, or Midjourney, which creates art for you. These are remarkable "digital brains," that process vast amounts of information, perform logical reasoning, and generating content. However, they all exist in a virtual world of data,  leading a **"disembodied"** existence, much like a "brain in a vat." They may know everything about an 'apple,' but they can never truly 'touch' or 'pick' a real one, let alone feel its cold or smooth surface.


**Embodied AI**, on the other hand, aims to break through this dimensional wall.

>Definition: Embodied AI refers to intelligent systems that can perceive, interact with, and learn from the real world through a physical body (such as robots, autonomous vehicles, and more). It emphasizes that an intelligent agent must have a "body" and engage with the environment through this body to develop a deeper, more grounded understanding of the world.

In simple terms, **Embodied AI = Intelligent Brain + Actionable Body**.

Embodied AI is not just about giving AI wheels or arms; it represents profound philosophical and technological changes. True intelligence doesn't simply emerge on its own; it arises through continuous interaction and feedback with the environment. This is much like how a human baby learns—not by reading an encyclopedia, but through grasping, crawling, falling, and exploring.


### Three Key Elements :

1.**Body**: The physical form of the intelligent agent, including sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, tactile sensors) for perception and actuators (e.g., motors, mechanical arms, wheels) for action.

2.**Brain**: The core of the intelligent algorithms that process data from the sensors, make decisions, and send instructions to the actuators. The brain usually involves advanced AI technologies, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language models.

3.**Environment**: The physical world in which the intelligent agent operates. As the stage where the agent learns and practices, it is filled with uncertainty, dynamic changes, and complex physical laws.

## 2. Development Timeline: From "Tottering" to "Striding"
Embodied AI doesn't develop overnight. Its development history is intertwined with the evolution of robotics and artificial intelligence technologies.

### **Phase 1: The Stumbling Pioneers (Mid 20th Century - Late 20th Century)**

* **Theoretical Origin:** Norbert Wiener, the founder of Cybernetics, and some other researchers were the first to propose the idea of machines interacting with their environment.

* **Landmark:** Between 1966 and 1972, the Stanford Research Institute developed the world’s first true mobile robot, **Shakey**, which is considered as the "ancestor" of embodied AI. The robot could perceive its surrounding environment, make plans, and execute simple tasks (such as pushing boxes). Though slow, it was groundbreaking as it marked the first time humans integrated perception, reasoning, and action into a single system.

*Robot "Ancestor" — Shakey*

### **Phase 2: Empowered by Deep Learning (Early 21st Century - 2020)**

* **Technological Breakthrough:** With the surge in computing power and the maturation of deep learning algorithms, computer vision technology gave robots sharper "eyes." Simultaneously, reinforcement learning allowed robots to learn complex skills through "trial and error," releasing humans from the need to write all the rules.

* **Star:** **Boston Dynamics** became the undeniable focal point of this era. From BigDog robot to the parkour-running, backflipping humanoid Atlas, the company showcased to the whole world how remarkable robots could be in terms of locomotion and balance.

*The agile Atlas robot showcases impressive athletic abilities.*

### **Phase 3: The Era of Large Models (2021 - Present)**

* **Paradigm Shift:** Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and PaLM have shown strong general understanding and reasoning abilities. Researchers were excited to discover that LLMs could serve as the "brain" for embodied AI,responsible for understanding high-level instructions and breaking them down into steps that robots can execute.

* **Representative Breakthroughs:**

<!-- It指代明晰吗？ -->
  * **Google's RT-2 Model:** Google's RT-2 Model proved for the first time that visual and language models could be directly applied to robot control. With end-to-end "Vision-Language-Action" control, the model allows robots to understand a complex command like "straighten the falling cola off the table."

  * **Tesla's Optimus Robot:** Tesla's Optimus Robot aims to create a universal "humanoid worker," building on Tesla's AI and visual perception capabilities developed for autonomous driving.

  * **Figure AI and OpenAI Collaboration:** ChatGPT's conversational and reasoning abilities integrated into the Figure 01 robot allows the robot to naturally converse with humans and understand and execute tasks.This is a milestone for embodied AI to go general.

## 4. Challenges and Future Outlook

The path to general embodied AI is still long and full of challenges.

### **Core Challenges:**

* **The "Sim-to-Real" Gap:** Models trained in simulators often fail to work properly in the real world because the real world is full of details and surprises that simulators cannot replicate.

* **Generalization Ability:** A critical aspect of generalization is ensuring that robots can make correct decisions and take actions, even when faced with objects or environments they've never encountered.

* **Data Scarcity:** Unlike the vast amounts of text and image data available online, high-quality robot interaction data is both costly and hard to come by.

* **Safety and Ethics:** Ensuring that the behavior of a physically capable AI system is safe, controllable, and aligned with human ethics is a critical issue that must be addressed.

### **Future Outlook:**

Despite the challenges, the future has arrived. With the ongoing integration of large models, new materials, and sensor technologies, there are things we can foresee:

1. **Stronger Generalization:** Future robots will no longer be "specialists" but versatile "generalists" like humans,that can learn and adapt to a variety of tasks. 

2. **More Natural Human-Robot Interaction:** We will be able to collaborate with robots using natural language, gestures, or even eye movements, making the interaction seamless.

3. **Emergence of Intelligent Physicality:** The ultimate goal of embodied AI is to let intelligent agents learn and spontaneously develop more advanced forms of intelligence through complex interactions with the physical world, even including forms we haven’t yet designed.

 **Conclusion:**

From the 'thinkers' of the virtual world to the 'doers' of the physical world, embodied AI is guiding AI into its next great journey. This is not just a technological leap but also a redefinition of 'intelligence' and the intelligent beings with whom we wish to coexist.

The door has already opened, revealing a world full of challenges—and infinite possibilities. We will all witness how this new, code-and-gear-driven 'species' learns, grows, and ultimately changes the world.
