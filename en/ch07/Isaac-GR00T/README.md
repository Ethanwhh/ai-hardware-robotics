## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How is GR00T different from other robot models?

GR00T is a general robot foundation model rather than a specialized model optimized for specific tasks. It employs a dual-system architecture that combines a fast system (intuition) and a slow system (reasoning), similar to human cognitive processes. Additionally, GR00T is designed to work across different robot platforms, not limited to specific hardware.

### 2. What kind of hardware do I need to run GR00T?

Running the full version of GR00T requires powerful GPU support. For complete inference and training, an NVIDIA RTX 3090 or higher GPU is recommended. For lightweight applications, cloud services or NVIDIA Jetson platforms can be used. The Jetson AGX Thor, specifically designed for humanoid robots, is ideal hardware for running GR00T.

### 3. How can I obtain data to train GR00T?

NVIDIA has released the GR00T N1 dataset as part of a larger open-source physical AI dataset, which can be downloaded from Hugging Face and GitHub. Additionally, NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint provides a framework for synthetic manipulation action generation to help you generate your own training data.
