   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

   # Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit
   distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

2. **Pull the Isaac Sim container**
   ```bash
   docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:latest
   ```

3. **Run the Isaac Sim container**
   ```bash
   docker run --gpus all -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" --rm -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:latest
   ```

### Cloud Deployment

Isaac Sim supports deployment on major cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc. Taking AWS as an example:

1. **Create an EC2 instance**
   - Select an instance type that supports NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., g4dn.xlarge)
   - Choose an AMI that includes NVIDIA drivers

2. **Install necessary components**
   - Update the system and install necessary packages
   - Configure X11 forwarding or use NICE DCV for remote access

3. **Install Isaac Sim following the workstation installation steps**

## üêç Python Environment Configuration

Isaac Sim includes a built-in Python environment, but you can also configure your own Python environment to interact with Isaac Sim:

1. **Create a Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   conda create -n isaac-sim python=3.9
   conda activate isaac-sim
   ```

2. **Install necessary packages**
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Configure Isaac Sim's Python path**
   - Add Isaac Sim's Python path to your environment variables
   - Or add the following code to your Python script:
     ```python
     import sys
     sys.path.append('/path/to/isaac-sim/python')
     ```
